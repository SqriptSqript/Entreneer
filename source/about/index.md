# Who are we?
We're two entreneer's. One from France and another from America.
	We're curious and assertively living life. One is peaceful, the other is rebellious.
	We both like to travel and build things. A great mix, I'll say. It's easy to be an entrepreneur or an engineer, just make the decision. Engineers are possibly the most educated in the room, they're on google most of the time. It's not unlikely for us to discover this lifestyle and take a step into entrepreneurship. Just look what we're surrounded by. Entreneers want to <b>learn things, build things and sell things.</b> with themselves or other people. That's what makes you and I an <i>Entreneer</i>. Before going over the bridge, it's a hard truth that sometimes in life, you might have to follow the sheep or sit when told. But only do that to get by, and not for the rest of our lives.
