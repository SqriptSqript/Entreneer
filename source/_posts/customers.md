 # Education is a business.

 People are making money from a student's hard-work. And the student thinks their hard work is bringing them closer to the cash. The reality is...they are losing it. Stay with me.
 So, as I was drawing ideas on my whiteboard in my office, I came upon the concept of education and realized the lucrative business in it which is motivated by people and ran by corporations and sole-proprietors. It was <b>Shocking</b>. There are millions of dollars being made from students every year, and I'm not talking about college tuition. The irony is, not many people know of the alternative paths to achieve wealth and knowledge. It is often free at your local library and meetup groups on the web. I know this can sound crazy. Allow me to explain, imagine this:
## Scenario #1
 #### You are a <b>student</b> in high school. You've failed all of your classes.
 Your parents may condemn you and order you to receive better grades. Correct?
  Some parents may enroll you into a tutoring program such as Kumon, or they may hire a personal tutor. This costs <b style="color:green;">money.</b>
  If you repeat a grade, most schools offer summer-school or credit-recovery programs which allows students to be pushed to their right grade. In college, you may have to pay more money if you fail a semester. Here's the Irony, Even If you <b>drop-out</b> of high school you are then influenced to get a G.E.D. Guess what, It costs <b style="color:green">money</b>. If you fail, people have already set a tollbooth to take your money.

   <b>The government and other businesses make money from student's failure</b>.

## Scenario #2
#### Your a student in high-school. Your on an A+ honor-roll.

Your parents may congratulate you. Most become proud of their child and enroll them into more programs to move further in their education or just to be ahead of the crowd, such as <u>dual enrollment (US)</u> a program where students are enrolled in both high school and college. This is designed so students can graduate high-school with a 2-year college degree. This is another <b style="color:green;">source of income</b> for the government. There are other extra-curricular programs for <u>certifications</u>, college courses, tests and other activities(as they differ across countries). These programs cost <b style="color:green;">money</b>.
 These businesses make money from student's and their parents desire to succeed to college.<br/>
<b> The government and many businesses are making money from student's success.</b>

 Now, you grasped an understanding of how businesses <b>can</b> earn money both ways. From a student's success or failure.
<br/>
<b>'Ok, It costs money, what's the problem?'</b> Because I want more people to be aware of the fact that they can live a happy, healthy and successful lifestyle of their dreams using less cash and work in less time without the large effort towards grades,tests,colleges,etc. When it's all just a method for the government and businesses to make money.
<br/>
<b>'Hm. how can I do that?'</b>.  Simply put, quit doing what other's say. Begin researching and thinking of creative ways to produce sources of income (there are many you don't know) and start executing. This goes for any age. If people spend $100k+ in debt for student loans, imagine how much money you can make if you invest that into a business?<br/>

#### Invest into your financial education (Money, Business and Law)

#### Invest your time and money into the things you are most interested in.
Your peers aka the ones who enjoys being instructed and completing assignments that has nothing to do with their life goals, <b>will work for you</b>. That's right. <i>They will work for you</i>. They like being told what to do and working on things unnecessary to their goals right? That's exactly what we want them to do when their working for us! This is exactly how the big corporation executives and entrepreneurs think. The time spent in school learning what the government requires you to learn could be spent investing into your own education. Which is really free at your local library, the internet and public colleges (sounds corny and cheap right?). The books at the libraries are worth thousands of dollars in total. It's free to us. The content found on the internet is worth thousands of dollars, It's free to us. You will be ahead of many. Many are studying, taking test and working very hard when they can work less and earn more by placing that same effort to invest in their knowledge and build their own sources of income instead of seeking income from others(jobs) which takes more time and more work.
Invest your money into your financial education and the things you are interested in. This counts for any-age. Do not wait a second. I've seen 6 year old entrepreneurs. I've heard of 70 y/o entrepreneurs. Your worth will flip a hundred-fold. Let your peers be instructed by teachers and given work unnecessary to their goals, <b>you will hire them</b>.

## How your money is taken in college.

### Standardized Tests
   This brings in thousands of dollars a year. Just think about it. It's a good business. Society pushes them to take it before entering college. It's a requirement.
   The college wants you to take a test, (pay someone)
   so you can then pay the application-fee and enroll in college (pay someone). Students are required to pay several people to enter a college and pursue their dreams. Do you see the picture I'm trying to frame? It is a business where they try to come up with all kinds of tests and requirements so more people can get paid. They are just taking your money while your on a pursuit to it. The absurdity of these test also lies in its content. <i>Sometimes</i> it is not associated with the student's goals. Most of the standardized-test material can be learned with a click of a button. The money spent on taking standardized-tests can go towards investing into your own knowledge and sources of income. I will say it again, The money spent on standardized tests can go towards investing into your own knowledge and sources of income.

   #### Prepatory classes for Standardized Tests

   You've seen some classes offering to assist you on your standardized tests? Some are free. Some requires payment. This is a nice place for a small business to grow and make well enough cash on student's thoughtless hard-work.

   <B> Standardized tests is another <span style="color:green;">source of income</span> for small businesses. </b>

   I hope I have changed or added a new perspective of the educational system to your mind.
   Take control of your life and question everything.
